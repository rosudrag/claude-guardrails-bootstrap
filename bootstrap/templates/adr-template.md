## ADR Guidelines

When writing ADRs:

1. **Be specific** - Vague decisions are hard to follow
2. **Include context** - Future readers need to understand the "why"
3. **List alternatives** - Shows the decision was considered carefully
4. **Keep it immutable** - Don't edit accepted ADRs; supersede them
5. **Link from code** - Reference `ADR-NNN` in related code comments
